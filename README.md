# MLB Outcomes #

**A Baseball Machine Learning Experiment**
This project predicts the outcomes of MLB baseball games with approx 67% accuracy. This is ~10% better than the casino oddsmakers.

## How it Works ##

The project is broken up into these parts:
1. **web scraper**: this builds a database of baseball stats sourced from [baseball-reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/).
2. **features**: cleans data and calculates additional statistics for each game.
3. **model**: finds the best parameters for our machine learning algorithm (xgboost)
4. **predict**: generates predictions for today's games

## How this Repo is Organized ##

We have these folders:
- **notebooks**: this project uses Jupyter notebooks to run all of the code. These notebooks are kept here.
- **code**: these are python files imported in the notebooks.
- **data**: this is where all of the data generated by the scripts is kept.

I hope you find it useful. I wrote a [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-mlb-game-outcomes-with-machine-learning-594eac9484e9) about the initial revision of this project. This repo contains the latest/greatest.
